# notes from our senior engineer at Wantful about s3:
# 1) generate a SHA of the contents and include that in the name of the image
# 2) Set the s3 folder to public but don't serve out of that folder, serve out of cloud front
# 3) Set the expiry on the image to very far future


# this way the files are cached in the user's browser
# and never pull from the server again
# if you need to update them, they change and you get a new hash
# this makes your bandwidth VERY small, makes your site VERY fast
# but it means you have to maintain a list of SHAs for every image to always refer to the latestâ€¦ which is a pain
# but it is worth it
# paperclip should have a lot of that built in

# So you should have something like ProductImage and have a sha field on it or have that right on the product, I don't know how you store those

# Matt Freeman: do we have a cloud front account set up?
# Alex Blunk: nope, set one up firing to support@farallon.co, just let me know what the pass is
